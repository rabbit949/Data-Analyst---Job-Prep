# Data Analyst - Job Prep

Welcome to the **Data Analyst - Job Prep** repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a space where I document my journey of learning SQL and Python for data analysis. While Iâ€™m learning and growing, I aim to share my progress, insights, and resources with others who are also preparing for data analyst roles. Together, we can learn, practice, and master the essential skills needed to succeed in the field of data analysis.
